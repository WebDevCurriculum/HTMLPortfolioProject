  <h3>More about me</h3>
  <p>I took my first coding class in September 2016, and have been hooked ever since! I love how web development is the perfect balance of artistic creativity, analytics and problem solving. Utilizing all of these skills keeps me continually engaged and eager to learn. </p>
